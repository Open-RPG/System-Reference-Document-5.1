# 5E System Reference Document v5.1

On January 20th, 2023 Wizards of the Coast released the "SRD", the System
Reference Document, describing the basic rules for its role playing game,
under the license known colloquially as the Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0, an
"open culture" license that promotes the open and free use of creative works
by the general public.

This project aims to make the content of the version 5.1 SRD available in a
format that's a little easier for people to work with. Microsoft Word doesn't
produce the most useful PDF documents, it turns out. Accessibility is poor,
document structure is obliterated, and often even single words are split by
Word's prehistoric and hamfisted attempts at things like font kerning.

We can do better. And for the sake of creators, gamers, and for Wizards of the
Coast who also benefits greatly from the widespread adoption of this SRD, we
are doing better.

We hope you find this Markdown version of the SRD useful!
