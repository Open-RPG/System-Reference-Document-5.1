## Diseases

A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the
adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer
emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for
centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a
wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power
and contracts a strange affliction that spreads
whenever he casts spells.
A simple outbreak might amount to little more
than a small drain on party resources, curable by a
casting of
 _lesser restoration_ . A more complicated
outbreak can form the basis of one or more
adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the
spread of the disease, and deal with the
consequences.
A disease that does more than infect a few party
members is primarily a plot device. The rules help
describe the effects of the disease and how it can be
cured, but the specifics of how a disease works
aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can
affect any creature, and a given illness might or
might not pass from one race or kind of creature to
another. A plague might affect only constructs or
undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood
but leave other races untouched. What matters is the
story you want to tell.

### Sample Diseases

The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways
disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the
saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and
other characteristics of these diseases to suit your
campaign.

#### Cackle Fever

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes
are strangely immune. While in the grips of this
disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad
laughter, giving the disease its common name and its
morbid nickname: "the shrieks."
Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and
include fever and disorientation. The infected
creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be
removed until the disease is cured.
Any event that causes the infected creature great
stress--including entering combat, taking damage,
experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the
creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic
damage and becomes incapacitated with mad
laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending

```
the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on
a success.
Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within
10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad
laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or also become infected with the
disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is
immune to the mad laughter of that particular
infected creature for 24 hours.
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature
can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a
successful save, the DC for this save and for the save
to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6.
When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature
recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three
of these saving throws gains a randomly determined
form of indefinite madness, as described later.
```
#### Sewer Plague

```
Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category
of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps,
and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes
transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas,
such as rats and otyughs.
When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature
that carries the disease, or when it comes into
contact with filth or offal contaminated by the
disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11
Constitution saving throw or become infected.
It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to
manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include
fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers
one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the
normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice
and no hit points from finishing a long rest.
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature
must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, the character gains one level of
exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's
exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a
successful saving throw reduces the infected
creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature
recovers from the disease.
```
#### Sight Rot

```
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes
and eventually blinds the victim.
A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by
sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or become infected. One day after
infection, the creature's vision starts to become
blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack
rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end
```

of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the
penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim
is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as
_lesser restoration_ or
 _heal_ .
Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called
Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an
hour, a character who has proficiency with an
herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of
ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one
dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after
that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the
disease entirely.


## Madness

In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad
by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict
day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an
adventurer can be too much to bear. If your
campaign has a strong horror theme, you might
want to use madness as a way to reinforce that
theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific
nature of the threats the adventurers face.

### Going Mad

Various magical effects can inflict madness on an
otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as
_contact other plane_ and
 _symbol_ , can cause insanity,
and you can use the madness rules here instead of
the spell effects of those spells_._ Diseases, poisons,
and planar effects such as psychic wind or the
howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict
madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of
a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.
Resi sting a madness-inducing effect usually
requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.

### Madness Effects

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite.
Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term
madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More
horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in
long -term or indefinite madness.
A character afflicted with
 **short-term madness** is
subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness
table for 1d10 minutes.
A character afflicted with
 **long-term madness** is
subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness
table for 1d10 × 10 hours.
A character afflicted with
 **indefinite madness**
gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite
Madness table that lasts until cured.

### Curing Madness

A
 _calm emotions_ spell can suppress the effects of
madness, while a
 _lesser restoration_ spell can rid a
character of a short-term or long-term madness.
Depending on the source of the madness,
 _remove
curse_ or
 _dispel evil_ might also prove effective. A
_greater restoration_ spell or more powerful magic is
required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
