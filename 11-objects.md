## Objects

When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter
a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard
and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right
tools, characters can destroy any destructible object.
Use common sense when determining a character's
success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut
through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No,
the sword is likely to break before the wall does.
For the purpose of these rules, an object is a
discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword,
book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a
vehicle that is composed of many other objects.

#### Statistics for Objects

When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class
and hit points to a destructible object. You can also
give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to
specific types of damage.
**_Armor Class._** An object's Armor Class is a measure
of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object
when striking it (because the object has no chance of
dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class
table provides suggested AC values for various
substances.

#### Object Armor Class

**Substance AC
**
Cloth, paper, rope
 11
Crystal, glass, ice
 13
Wood, bone 15
Stone 17
Iron, steel 19
Mithral 21
Adamantine
 23

**_Hit Points._** An object's hit points measure how
much damage it can take before losing its structural
integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than
fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit
points than small ones, unless breaking a small part
of t he object is just as effective as breaking the whole
thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested
hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are
Large or smaller.

#### Object Hit Points

**Size Fragile Resilient**
Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4)
Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6)
Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8)
Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10)

Huge and Gargantuan Objects.
 Normal weapons
are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan
objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of
stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can
burn a Huge tapestry, and an
 earthquake spell can
reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or
Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can
simply decide how long the object can withstand
whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you
track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or
smaller sections, and track each section's hit points
separately. Destroying one of those sections could
ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan
statue of a human might topple over when one of its
Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.
Objects and Damage Types. Objects are immune
to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that
some damage types are more effective against a
particular object or substance than others. For
example, bludgeoning damage works well for
smashing things but not for cutting through rope or
leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable
to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away
stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always,
use your best judgment.
Damage Threshold.
 Big objects such as castle
walls often have extra resilience represented by a
damage threshold. An object with a damage
threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes
an amount of damage from a single attack or effect
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in
which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage
that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage
threshold is considered superficial and doesn't
reduce the object's hit points.

## Poisons

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are
illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among
assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types.
**_Contact._** Contact poison can be smeared on an
object and remains potent until it is touched or
washed off. A creature that touches contact poison
with exposed skin suffers its effects.
**_Ingested.
_** A creature must swallow an entire dose
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can
be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that
a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing
advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half
dam age on a failed save.
**_Inhaled.
_** These poisons are powders or gases that
take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or
releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube
to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates
immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is
ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect
nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the
body.
**_Injury.
_** Injury poison can be applied to weapons,
ammunition, trap components, and other objects
that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains
potent until delivered through a wound or washed
off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing
damage from an object coated with the poison is
exposed to its effects.

### Sample Poisons

Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.

```
Assassin's Blood (Ingested). A creature subjected
to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12)
poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a
successful save, the creature takes half damage and
isn't poisoned.
Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). A creature
subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison
damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the
start of each of its turns. On each successive failed
save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage.
After three successful saves, the poison ends.
Crawler Mucus (Contact). This poison must be
harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A
creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for
1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.
Drow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically
made only by the drow, and only in a place far
removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this
poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw
fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious
while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if
it takes damage or if another creature takes an
action to shake it awake.
Essence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected
to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The
poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature
wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature
takes an action to shake it awake.
Malice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this
poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned
creature is blinded.
Midnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that
ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke
of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized
before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17
Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
Oil of Taggit (Contact). A creature subjected to
this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The
poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature
wakes up if it takes damage.
```

**_Pale Tincture (Ingested)._** A creature subjected to
this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution
saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and
become poisoned. The poisoned creature must
repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3
(1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this
poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be
healed by any means. After seven successful saving
throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal
normally.
**_Purple Worm Poison (Injury)._** This poison must
be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple
worm. A creature subjected to this poison must
make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42
(12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
**_Serpent Venom (Injury)._** This poison must be
harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant
poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw,
taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
**_Torpor (Ingested)._** A creature subjected to this
poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The
poisoned creature is incapacitated.
**_Truth Serum (Ingested)._** A c reature subjected to
this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The
poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if
under the effect of a
 _zone of truth_ spell.
**_Wyvern Poison (Injury)._** This poison must be
harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A
